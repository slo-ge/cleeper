# cleeper

**The project is currentliy WIP, so no stable version available at the moment.**

cleeper is a tool for pasting images and texts of clipboard to a chrome browser view.
It is based on the python eel library which communicates between python and the browser. 

Currently cleeper only shows the history of the clipboard and is only tested on windows with python 3.7. 

### How to 
* Install pipenv packages 
* Run app.py 
* Use `ctrl+l` to paste clipboard items to browser

TODO: provide windows executable
